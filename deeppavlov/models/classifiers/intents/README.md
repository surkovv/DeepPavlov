# Neural Model for Intent Classification

In this repo one can find code for training and infering intent classification model
that is presented as shallow-and-wide Convolutional Neural Network[1]. 
The model is multi-class and multi-label that means each text of a dataset 
can belong to several classes or not belong to any one.

Also there is presented pre-trained model for user intent classification for DSTC 2 dataset [CITE].
Intents for user replies are being constructed by IntentDataset (`deeppavlov/datasets/intent_dataset.py`).
Below several examples of intent construction are given:

> System: "Hello, welcome to the Cambridge restaurant system. You can ask for restaurants by area, price range or food type. How may I help you?"
>
> User: "cheap restaurant"

In the original dataset this user reply has characteristics
`"goals": {"pricerange": "cheap"}, "db_result": null, "dialog-acts": [{"slots": [["pricerange", "cheap"]], "act": "inform"}]}`.
This message contains the only intent `inform_pricerange`.

> User: "thank you good bye",

In the original dataset this user reply has characteristics 
`"goals": {"food": "dontcare", "pricerange": "cheap", "area": "south"}, "db_result": null, "dialog-acts": [{"slots": [], "act": "thankyou"}, {"slots": [], "act": "bye"}]}`
This message contains two intents `(thankyou, bye)`.
