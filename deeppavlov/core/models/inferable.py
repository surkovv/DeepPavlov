"""
:class:`deeppavlov.models.model.Inferable` is an abstract base class that expresses the interface
for all models that can work for inferring. The scope of all inferring models is larger than the scope
of trainable models. For example, encoders can be inferred, but can't be trained.
All inferring models should inherit from this class.
