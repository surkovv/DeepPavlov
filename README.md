__In version 0.0.6 everything from package `deeppavlov.skills` except `deeppavlov.skills.pattern_matching_skill` was moved to `deeppavlov.models` so your imports might break__  


DeepPavlov is an open-source conversational AI library built on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). It is designed for
 * development of production ready chat-bots and complex conversational systems,
 * NLP and dialog systems research.

# Hello Bot in DeepPavlov

Import key components to build HelloBot. 
```python
from deeppavlov.core.agent import Agent, HighestConfidenceSelector
from deeppavlov.skills.pattern_matching_skill import PatternMatchingSkill
```

Create skills as pre-defined responses for a user's input containing specific keywords. Every skill returns response and confidence.
```python
hello = PatternMatchingSkill(responses=['Hello world! :)'], patterns=["hi", "hello", "good day"])
bye = PatternMatchingSkill(['Goodbye world! :(', 'See you around.'], ["bye", "chao", "see you"])
fallback = PatternMatchingSkill(["I don't understand, sorry :/", 'I can say "Hello world!" 8)'])
```

Agent executes skills and then takes response from the skill with the highest confidence.
```python
HelloBot = Agent([hello, bye, fallback], skills_selector=HighestConfidenceSelector())
```

Give the floor to the HelloBot!
```python
print(HelloBot(['Hello!', 'Boo...', 'Bye.']))
```

# Installation

0. Currently we support only `Linux` platform and `Python 3.6` (**`Python 3.5` is not supported!**)

1. Create a virtual environment with `Python 3.6`:
    ```
    virtualenv env
    ```
2. Activate the environment:
    ```
    source ./env/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the package inside this virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install deeppavlov
    ```

# Demo 

Demo of selected features is available at [demo.ipavlov.ai](https://demo.ipavlov.ai/)

# Quick start

To use our pre-trained models, you should first install their requirements:
```
python -m deeppavlov install <path_to_config>
```
  
Then download the models and data for them:
```
python -m deeppavlov download <path_to_config>
```
or you can use additional key `-d` to automatically download all required models and data with any command like `interact`, `riseapi`, etc.

Then you can interact with the models or train them with the following command:

```
python -m deeppavlov <mode> <path_to_config> [-d]
```

* `<mode>` can be `train`, `predict`, `interact`, `interactbot` or `riseapi`
* `<path_to_config>` should be a path to an NLP pipeline json config (e.g. `deeppavlov/configs/ner/slotfill_dstc2.json`)
or a name without the `.json` extension of one of the config files [provided](deeppavlov/configs) in this repository (e.g. `slotfill_dstc2`)

For the `interactbot` mode you should specify Telegram bot token in `-t` parameter or in `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` environment variable. Also if you want to get custom `/start` and `/help` Telegram messages for the running model you should:
* Add section to `utils/telegram_utils/model_info.json` with your custom Telegram messages
* In model config file specify `metadata.labels.telegram_utils` parameter with name which refers to the added section of `utils/telegram_utils/model_info.json`

For `riseapi` mode you should specify api settings (host, port, etc.) in [*utils/server_utils/server_config.json*](utils/server_utils/server_config.json) configuration file. If provided, values from *model_defaults* section override values for the same parameters from *common_defaults* section. Model names in *model_defaults* section should be similar to the class names of the models main component.

For `predict` you can specify path to input file with `-f` or `--input-file` parameter, otherwise, data will be taken
from stdin.  
Every line of input text will be used as a pipeline input parameter, so one example will consist of as many lines,
as many input parameters your pipeline expects.  
You can also specify batch size with `-b` or `--batch-size` parameter.
